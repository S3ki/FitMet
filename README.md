# Fitmet üèÉ


**Fitmet** is a motivational step-tracking app designed to **encourage daily movement** through a positive, visually engaging experience. It tracks your steps in real time and boosts your motivation with:


- **Encouraging messages**
- **Clean and uplifting UI**
- **Interactive graph visualizations** of your progress

Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or aiming to stay consistent, **Fitmet** makes every step count‚Äîliterally.

## Requirements

  - Device must include a **Step Counter Sensor** (`Sensor.TYPE_STEP_COUNTER`)
    - Not all devices running Android 4.4+ support this sensor
    - The app checks for sensor availability at runtime
- **Permissions**:
  - Access to physical activity (required on Android 10 and above)

    
## Installation

To install and run the app from the source code:

1. **Clone the repository**:

## Architecture

The application is structured using the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure a clear separation between the user interface and business logic.
